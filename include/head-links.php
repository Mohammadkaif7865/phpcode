This requires setting up a robot.txt file, creating an XML sitemap, and fixing crawl issues. Website speed and mobile responsiveness are also key factors in technical SEO. On-Page SEO It is mandatory to optimize every separate page as search engines rank individual pages. A well-structured page, titles, and heading tags optimized with targeted keywords, descriptive URLs aid good on-page optimization. Content SEO: While most people consider content optimization and On-Page SEO the same, there is a slight difference in its relevance as a ranking factor. Content on a website should be optimized to aid a visitor's journey to conversion. Off-Page SEO It is mandatory to optimize every separate page as search engines rank individual pages. A well-structured page, titles, and heading tags optimized with targeted keywords, descriptive URLs aid good on-page optimization.
